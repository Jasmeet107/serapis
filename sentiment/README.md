# Stage 3: Sentiment Analysis
Train and use a TreeLSTM model to predict sentiment on parse trees.

See the instructions in the `treelstm/` root directory to setup and train the model.

See `predict.py` for the `SentimentPredictor` class and an example usage.

See the `testing/` directory for both sentence and confession level testing of the model.
